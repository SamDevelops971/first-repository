# This is my first ever independent project. It is a small tic-tac-toe program that allows the user to either go up against another person or a robot. The robot is done using a random scanner and removes its input from an ArrayList. 
# I did this project to get some practice in with looping, scanners, and connecting different methods to one another. :)
